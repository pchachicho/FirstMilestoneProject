first milestone project during cybersecurity bootcamp.

this game uses javascript,HTML,CSS

CSS is used to animate the text, change its font, change its color, make the text and canvas center,

Javascript is used to define how big the map is, pacman moving functions, collisions, inserting images for the map,audio,wolf ai, and causing a loose condition, tileMap size


Directions: Survive as long as you can! use the up,down,left,right keys on your keyboard to move pacman. After 20 seconds the wolfs get restless!
 Dont get hit or its game over!

bugs: grass patches do not spawn on wolves spawn location, wolf audio still plays even if dead

what i can do better: increase some icons size, add a score that starts counting the survival time, little bit better css,
make the trees have a little better background, audio sound level,
